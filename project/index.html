			<p class="Biography">Hello my name is heave/BBG I come from a place where a lot of things that aren't suppose to be recognized are. I also come from a place where people show fake love to one another which is why I think WestCoast Connections would be a great way to bring some light to Seattle Especially. Example, what do you think about when you hear Seattle? Moody weather, moody people, and just it being a gloomy city. I want to change that hopefully with some comfortable streetwear.<p>
